# Spotify-COVER-IMAGE-DOWNLOADER
This windows GUI app provides downloading cover images of the songs you are looking for. (You can search)
To be able to use this app, firstly you should create a spotify developers account and get your spotify client id, secret codes. 
Then, you should put these codes into the required place in the main.py file. (<spotify client id> , <spotify client secret>)

By using the setup.py with the following steps, you can install this application to your computer as an exe application:
1. Use the command prompt (cmd) to run python setup.py build. 
2. (Run this command from the folder containing setup.py.) 
3. Notice the build parameter we added at the end of the script call.

IMPORTANT NOTE: To make this code work properly, you should directly download this folder, because the other files are required like: application.ui,notfound.png,example.log
